# Printing

Printing is one of the easiests things to program into your code. You are probably wondering what exectly printing is, printing is programing your code to give you an output when you run it. this may sound complicated but it's as easy as writing out a sentance or combination of numbers, putting (" "); around it, and telling it to print. In Java the Syntax for this is System.out.print(""); or System.out.println("");. If you want to print out any variable that was already defined you don't need quotes so it will be System.out.println(); instead.

## Examples 

1). Print out the words "Hello User!"
     System.out.println("Hello User!");

2). Print out the defined variable int x = 3;
     System.out.println(x);
    
3). Print out the number 43 without using a variable
     System.out.print("43");
