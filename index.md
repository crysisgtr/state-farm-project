What is coding mouse?


Coding Mouse is a website with multiple mini lessons we made to teach kids who have no coding expierience. Our lessons are fun, simple, and informative

each lesson contains
- A paragraph that the student can read to learn basic knowledges
- A video that shows and teaches the techinique
- A interactive way to practice the new lesson


We aspire to get kids interested in coding so that they may be more likely to at least take one computer science class in high school to see if it is right for them. We think that any kid has potential to be a great programmer, and by giving them access to learning how to code, they may decide that they want to pursue a computer science related field.
