# Loops


### Loops

Loops, also called _iterations_, are a way to repeat one or more statements. Computer Programmers use loops because they save a lot of space in the code. There are two types of codes that we will go over in todays lesson, 'for' and 'while' loops. Both loops are essential but 'for' loops are more commonly used. 

### While Loops

While loops are dependent on the 'boolean' type that we learned about earlier. A while loops executes the body of a loop while the boolean conditional is _true_. When the conditional is false, we exit loop and continue with the code that is after the loop. When writing a while loop there is a certain format you must use which we will have examples to show. Example number two will show a loop that executes 10 times.
                                           int count = 0
Example:while (condition)      Example #2: while (count < 10)
       {                                   {
            statements;                         count++;
       }                                   {

### For Loops

For loops are normally used when you know how many times you want the loop to run. For loops are also dependent on a boolean conditional statement being true. A 'for' loop statement has a similar format to a 'while' loop but there are differences in the conditions. We will have an example to show how to format a for loop, then the second example will be a for loop that executes 10 times.

Example: for (initialization; condition; change)            for(int x = 0; x < 10; x++)
         {                                                  {
             statements;                                         statements;
         {                                                  {
