# Primitive Types


### Primitive Types

A primitive type is one of the two ways to store a variable. There are three categories of primitive types: int, double, and boolean. In this lesson we will cover all three of these types. 

To declare, or create a variable, you have to follow a certain layout. The layout is " _ primitive type_ _variable name_ = _value_;".

### Int Values

The primitive type "int" is a variable that holds integer values, ie 1, 903, -523, 1,542,578. Int values can undergo 'operators', for example addition('+'), subtraction('-'), multiplication('*'), and division('/'). Along with operators, you can check if two values are the same by using ('=='). 

Example: int numberOfStudents = 32;

### Double Values
