# Primitive Types


### Primitive Types

A primitive type is one of the two ways to store a variable. There are three categories of primitive types: int, double, and boolean. In this lesson we will cover all three of these types. 

To declare, or create a variable, you have to follow a certain layout. The layout is "_primitive type_ _variable name_ = _value_;". When declaring primitive types, they should all be lowercased, ie 'int'.

### Int Values

The primitive type "int" is a variable that holds integer values, ie 1, 903, -523, 1,542,578. 'int' values can undergo 'operators', for example addition('+'), subtraction('-'), multiplication('*'), and division('/'). Along with operators, you can check if two values are the same by using ('=='). Also with int values, you can put '++' after the variable and it will add '1' to the variable.

Example: int numberOfStudents = 32;

### Double Values

The primitive type "double" is a variable that holds decimal numbers, ie 1.0, 932.34, -523.9, 1,542,578.02984. 'double' values can also undergo the same 'operators'. Use double when you are dealing with decimal numbers like percents, or prices, and etc.  

Example: double percentScore = 95.0; 

### Boolean Values

The third and final primitive type "boolean" is a variable that holds 'true' or 'false'. 'boolean' values cannot undergo operators like int and double can. You can use boolean to answer things like, 'Is it sunny today?', or 'Does the class have more males than females?'. Boolean also can go along with more complicated things like 'if' and 'else' statements that we will learn about on the other page.

Example: boolean sunny = false;
